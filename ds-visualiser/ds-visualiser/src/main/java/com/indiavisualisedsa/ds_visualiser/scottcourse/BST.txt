1.Binary tree - It can only point to two nodes.
2.Full Tree - Every nodes either point to two or zero nodes.
3.Perfect tree - At any level all nodes are full.
4.Complete tree - filling the tree from left to right not 
necessarily complete.
5.Two child node having same parents are siblings.
6.Node having no children is called leaf.
7.Binary Search Tree - value smaller than parent node is placed on the
left and vice versa.
8.No of nodes at a level is 2 to power n minus 1 where n is the level.
9.to insert or search a node the complexity is (O(log(n)))(divide and rule).
10.If a tree never forks it is essentially a linked list. So actually for 
lookup, insert and move it is (O(n)).
